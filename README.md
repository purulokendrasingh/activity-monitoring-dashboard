# Activity Monitoring App

The Advanced Sensor and Activity Monitoring System is a cutting-edge solution designed to provide real-time insights into various aspects of device behavior and user interactions on Android devices. By leveraging advanced sensor technologies, comprehensive backend APIs, and intuitive frontend visualization, the system empowers users to gain actionable insights and optimize their device usage patterns. This documentation offers an extensive overview of both the Android application and the backend system, covering functionalities, implementation details, deployment processes, and integration methods.

This repository contains the code for the backend services built in Flask to communicate with the App.

Please refer to the following repository for more details about the App: https://github.com/purulokendrasingh/activity-monitoring-app/tree/master

Currently the deployment process is using docker images pushed to DockerHub, and containers are provisioned on Azure App Service for reliable and scalable deployment.

[TODO:] Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines may be implemented to automate the deployment process and streamline development workflows.
